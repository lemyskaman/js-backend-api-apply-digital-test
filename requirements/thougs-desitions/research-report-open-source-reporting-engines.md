# Research Report: Open Source Reporting Engines Analysis for Easy NestJS Integration (2025)


***

## Overview

**This report provides a comprehensive comparison of open source (and free) reporting engines relevant for JavaScript/TypeScript (NestJS) projects as of 2025. It covers JasperReports-like template features, WYSIWYG report designers, database connectivity, integration ease, resource consumption, and ecosystem notes.**

***

## Major Engines Reviewed

- **JSReport** (JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem)
- **Stimulsoft Reports.JS** (JavaScript/Node.js, desktop/browser designers)
- **Puppeteer-based custom pipelines** (Node.js, HTML/CSS templating)
- *Reference: JasperReports (Java, XML, legacy standard)*

***

## Feature Comparison Table

| Feature | JSReport | Stimulsoft Reports.JS | Puppeteer + HTML/CSS/Handlebars | JasperReports (Reference) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Reporting Language/Stack | JavaScript/Node.js/TS | JavaScript/Node.js/TS | JavaScript/Node.js/TS | Java (JVM) |
| Report Template Format | JSON, DOCX, HTML, Handlebars | MRT (JSON/XML), HTML, JS-based | HTML, Handlebars, EJS, D3 | XML (.jrxml) |
| WYSIWYG Designer | Paid web studio, DOCX, HTML | Windows/Electron/browser (full) | External HTML builder (e.g. GrapesJS) | JasperSoft Studio (Eclipse) |
| Export Formats | PDF, Excel, HTML, DOCX, PNG | PDF, Excel, HTML, SVG, CSV, JSON | PDF, PNG, HTML via Chrome | PDF, Excel, HTML, Print |
| NestJS/Node Integration | Native SDK, REST, examples | Native NPM, direct API, config | Trivial JS code, NPM packages | REST API, wrappers |
| Resource Consumption | Moderate (Chrome for PDF) | Moderate | Moderate/high (Chrome-based) | High (Java/JVM) |
| Extensibility | High (plugins, hooks, REST) | High (adapters, plugins) | Unlimited (by code/design) | High |


***

## Database Connectivity

| Engine | Built-in DB Support | Extensibility | Typical Approach | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| JSReport | None (agnostic); Node fetch | Any supported by NodeJS | Custom code/hook | Fetch/query via Node code, inject as data |
| Stimulsoft Reports.JS | SQL (MSSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle), ODBC, REST, CSV, JSON, Mongo, etc | Custom adapters; Node, .NET, others | GUI or code, design-time support | Visual integration, direct queries/config |
| Puppeteer + HTML/CSS | No built-in; code fetch | Any supported by NodeJS | Manual JS code | JS client code queries DB, builds HTML/CSS |
| JasperReports | Native JDBC, SQL, XML datasources | High (Java ecosystem) | Java extension | Extensive legacy database and Java support |

- **JSReport:** Database connection via beforeRender hooks or service classes; supports any DB accessible through Node.js (MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.). No built-in connectors—developers handle data fetch and inject to template.[^1][^2]
- **Stimulsoft Reports.JS:** Includes GUI-based or adapter-based connectors; supports major RDBMS and REST endpoints. Easily configured at design time or runtime for live datasets.[^3][^4][^5]
- **Puppeteer-based solutions:** Fully delegated to JS/Node code; connect to any DB, transform results to HTML, then export PDF/other formats.[^6][^7]

***

## WYSIWYG Designers

- **JSReport Studio (paid):** Web-based, drag-and-drop report designer; export as JSON/XML. Free core supports template authoring in HTML, DOCX, Handlebars, etc..[^8][^9]
- **Stimulsoft Reports.JS Designer:** Desktop and browser options; rich drag-and-drop UI with chart/maps/barcode components; output templates directly used in Node.js apps.[^10]
- **Bold Reports / DevExpress / others:** Commercial browser-based designers, focus on React/.NET/Next.js. Can produce RDL/RDLC, which may be used as templates but require compatible rendering engines.[^11][^12]
- **HTML template editors (GrapesJS, etc.):** May serve as external designers for code-driven pipelines (e.g. Puppeteer-based), but require developer glue code.

***

## Integration with NestJS

### **JSReport**

- Direct Node.js/NestJS SDKs \& samples available.[^9][^13][^14][^8]
- Bring-your-own templates; use DOCX, Handlebars, HTML, JSON.
- Define service/provider to generate reports from in-app data objects.
- REST API, CLI, and asset pipeline integration supported.
- Resource needs: Chrome headless used for some formats; typically moderate for single reports, scales horizontally for high load.


### **Stimulsoft Reports.JS**

- Native JS SDK; instantiate or load designer/exporter components inside NestJS or pure Node services.
- Adapters for databases and data files; connector GUI and runtime API.
- Fast performance and moderate resource use; electron-based designer available for Windows/Linux/Mac.
- Licensing for advanced/design components is commercial.


### **Puppeteer/Custom HTML Pipelines**

- Any Node.js project can use NPM libraries to fetch data, template HTML, and convert with Puppeteer or similar engines to PDF, PNG, etc.
- No WYSIWYG builder unless you use an external editor.
- Best for developer-centric, total control scenarios.

***

## Trends \& Best Practices

- **Template formats:** Modern engines favor JSON and HTML/Handlebars over XML.
- **Designers:** Move toward browser/cloud WYSIWYG, often as paid components; open-source alternatives often still code-centric.
- **Database connectivity:** Visual configuration and adapters available in Stimulsoft; JSReport and Puppeteer-based apps rely on Node code for full flexibility.
- **REST \& API-first reporting:** All major solutions work well with RESTful data sources for microservice-friendly architectures.
- **Resource consumption:** Chrome-based PDF export is now standard, with tradeoffs in parallelism/scaling.

***

## Recommendations

- **For JasperReports-like experience in Node/NestJS:** **JSReport** is closest fit; supports template-based, language-agnostic reports, with browser designer add-ons and excellent Node compatibility. All Node-accessible databases can be injected via code.
- **Visual, drag-and-drop design/business user orientation (with native DB support):** **Stimulsoft Reports.JS** offers the richest integrated experience.
- **Developer-driven, ultimate flexibility:** **Custom HTML/CSS/JS + Puppeteer** fits CI/CD \& DevOps, supports any data source but lacks visual designer unless integrated externally.
